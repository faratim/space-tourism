## Overview

Using the provided images, design system, and tutorials, I created the Space Tourism website. The tutorials helped me build the Home, Destinations, and Crew pages. Using what I learned, I built the Technology page completely on my own.

The site uses only pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript to show my understanding of those languages.

The website includes all features needed for proper accessibility, including considerations for users with screen readers and users without a mouse.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
